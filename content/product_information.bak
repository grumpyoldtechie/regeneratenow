Joints form the connections between your bones and provide the body with support and facilitate movement.  When joints are painful, everyday tasks may be difficult.  Joint pain can be caused by injury affecting any of the ligaments, bursae, or tendons surrounding the joint. Injury can also affect the ligaments, cartilage, and bones within the joint. [Pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm) </a>is also a feature of [joint inflammation, arthritis](https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm), such as [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm) and [osteoarthritis](https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm). Inflammation within the joint is a common cause of [shoulder pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/shoulder_pain/symptoms.htm), [ankle pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/ankle_pain_and_tendinitis/article.htm), and [knee pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/knee_pain_facts/article.htm). Joint pain is also referred to as [arthralgia](https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm). 

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and builds bones, muscles, tendons and skin. 
As we age our bodies produce less collagen. This has an impact on how we look and function.  

The loss of collagen is usually associated with symptoms such as: 

* The skin loses elasticity, wrinkles form and wounds heal more slowly. 
* Tendons and ligaments are stiffer and flexibility becomes less. 
* Muscle mass decreases and the body becomes weaker. 
* Cartilage wears down and joint pain and even Rheumatism or Osteoarthritis may develop.
* Intestinal linings become thinner. 

Until now, the only way to supplement collagen in the body, was to use exogenous collagen (collagen made in factories by man from animal bones, skin and other animal by products).  This is a synthetic collagen which is the most abundant and consists of: 

* Type 1 collagen:  Marine collagen from fish scales and bones, crustaceans, and other sea creatures.   
* Type 2 collagen made from chicken sternum 
* Type 3 collagen made from bovine peptides 

<p style="text-align: left; color: red;" >It is important to note that: </p>

Exogenous collagen (Man- made collagen) may cause allergies and even death.  Those with a fish, shellfish, or egg allergy should avoid collagen supplements as many of them are made from these ingredients.  Research has shown that taking too much exogenous collagen can make your skin stretch, thicken, and harden.  It can also cause damage to internal organs, such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys.  Problems also include: osteogenesis imperfecta (also called brittle bone disease), caused by a problem with type I collagen.  Elhers-Danlos syndrome, which leads to stretchy skin and joints, often caused by a problem with type IV collagen.  Further collagen supplements are not recommended for those with a high risk of developing kidney stones.  Collagen is a vital "building block" that contributes to the shape and function of the skin, heart, blood vessels and other organs. When synthesis exceeds degradation, there is a net accumulation of collagen that can eventually become fibrosis.  When blood vessels become stiff due to fibrosis, the heart works harder to keep blood flowing through the vessels. This increases blood pressure.   As fibrosis progresses, cells in the heart and blood vessels are encased in a "cement-like" collagen mesh.  The heart and vessels become stiffer, and their cells can no longer function properly.

High calcium levels or hypercalcemia may occur as a possible side effect of collagen supplements. Specifically, collagen supplements that come from marine sources, like shark cartilage or shellfish, can contain high levels of calcium. 
Too much calcium in the body can cause: 

* Constipation 
* Bone pain 
* Fatigue 
* Nausea 
* Vomiting 
* Abnormal heart rhythms 

   
<p style="text-align: left; color: orange;" >The sad part is that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that taking collagen supplements actually helps repair body tissues.  The body’s ability to absorb Exogenous (Synthetic/man made) collagen is still debateable. </p>


<p style="text-align: left; color: red;" >The good news is: </p>

We live in exciting times where advances in science are moving at a rapid pace. Science can now help the human body to <span style="color: red;">produce its own collagen again!</span>  This helps us to stay healthy, young, active, vibrant and attractive.  We are seeing more and more scientific proof of how a holistic, natural approach to health and wellness is the smarter way forward. 

Using the latest technology and world-leading formulations, we present a unique product, made of organic, glycine-bound minerals and vitamins.  This formulation is composed to assist the body to naturally synthesize collagen (Endogenous collagen).   Your body<a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/the-best-way-you-can-get-more-collagen/"> creates its own collagen </a>by combining amino acids. The process also uses vitamin C, zinc and copper. 
 
<p style="text-align: left; color: blue;" >How can collagen naturally be produced in the body by taking an organic vitamin and mineral product?</p>

Collagen should be naturally produced by our bodies, but production slows down at a certain stage.   Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins; therefore, it is no surprise that collagen is comprised of amino acids. The primary amino acid sequence of collagen is glycine-proline-X or glycine-X- hydroxyproline.  Collagen is composed of 3 chains. The chains are wound together to form a triple helix.  Since glycine is the smallest of all the amino acids, it allows the chain to form a tight configuration, and it can withstand stress.  In the forming of Collagen in the body, glycine is required at every third position on the collagen helix structure, because the assembly of the triple helix puts this residue at the interior (axis) of the helix, where there is no space for a larger side group than glycine's single hydrogen atom. 

Because of the nutrient collapse, pollution, stress and other factors our bodies need more and more nutrient supplements and glycine and other amino acids, are needed to act as carriers for transporting minerals in the body.  Glycine and other amino acids are not available anymore to produce collagen, because they become “too busy” trying to transport minerals.  

This product is unique and by formulation the only one of its kind in the world!  The minerals are bound to the smallest amino-acid, glycine.  Therefore glycine in the body does not have to “work” to transport minerals, but is now free to build collagen!
